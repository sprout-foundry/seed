// SummarizerHint conveys optional shaping parameters from seed's compaction
// pipeline to a consumer-supplied LLMSummarizer. All fields are advisory: a
// summarizer that ignores hints still satisfies the contract.
type SummarizerHint struct {
	// DetailLevel is one of "brief", "summary", "detailed", or "" (default).
	// Layered compaction uses these to graduate detail across age bands of the
	// conversation: brief for oldest content, detailed for newest middle.

// LLMSummarizer is the seed extension point for LLM-based structural
// compaction. Consumers (like sprout) provide an implementation that calls
// their LLM to compress a window of older conversation history into a single
// summary string.
//
// The function receives the messages to summarize (read-only — implementations
// must not mutate the slice) and a SummarizerHint shaping the response.
// It returns the raw summary text — seed wraps it into the standard
// "Compacted earlier conversation state:" header before splicing into history.
//
// A nil summarizer disables LLM-based structural compaction; seed then falls
// back to its rule-based compaction (drop oldest turns + emergency truncate).
//
// Implementations should:
//   - Honor ctx cancellation. Long-running summary calls block the chat loop.
//   - Return ("", nil) if the summary would be empty or low-value; seed treats
//     this as "skip LLM summary, fall through to structural compaction".
//   - Return (s, err) with err non-nil if the underlying call failed; seed
//     logs and falls back to rule-based compaction.
type LLMSummarizer func(ctx context.Context, messages []Message, hint SummarizerHint) (string, error)

// ArtifactBlockFunc renders a deterministic record of the durable artifacts
// (files touched) in a message span. Structural compaction calls it once per
// pass with the whole summarized span and appends the result to the final
// summary body, so the record appears exactly once no matter how many
// summarizer calls built that body. Return "" for a span with nothing to
// record.
//
// The distinction matters: a summarizer that appends its own artifact block is
// invoked once per layer by the layered pass, and the merged body would carry
// one block per layer. A hook here runs after the merge.
//
// Deduping across carried blocks is the consumer's job: a file edited both
// before and after a compaction appears in the carried summary's record and
// again in the new one, and seed writes both verbatim.

// compaction pass. The zero value preserves the historical behavior.

	ArtifactBlock ArtifactBlockFunc
}

// withArtifactBlock appends the artifact record for span to body. Returns body
// unchanged when the hook is nil, the span has no artifacts, or body is empty.
//
// The empty-body check is a backstop: both callers already return "no change"
// on an empty or whitespace-only summary before reaching here, so the
// fall-through-to-rule-based-compaction contract is enforced there. It stays
// because a manifest-only body would be treated as a usable summary and
// spliced in place of the narrative, which is worth guarding against twice.
